# DailyPause
A simple mindfulness plugin for Chrome and Firefox

## Why use this extension?
Many of us are able to keep good habits throughout our lives. We generally remember to do that things that are important to us. 

One common thread however, is that while people can maintain such good habits, few ever persistently remember to meditate each day, even if it is only 2 minutes.

Other apps like headspace are great, but they offer too many features and many users (like myself) use a desktop computer more frequently than our mobile devices. Some of us just need to be reminded to meditate daily and have the tool right at our fingertips so that we can do it quickly and easily without the excuses we make to ourselves as to why we can't today. 

If you are someone who just wants to meditate a little each day, uses a desktop more than a mobile phone and doesn't need all the fancy stuff offered by headspace, this Chrome extension is for you!
